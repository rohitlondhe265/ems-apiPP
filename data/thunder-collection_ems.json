Six friends decide to share a big cake. Since all of them like the cake, they begin quarrelling as to who gets to first cut and has a piece of the cake. One friend suggests that they blindfold a friend and then choose from a well shuffled set of cards numbered from one to six. You check and find that this method works as it should be simulating a fair throw of a die. You check by performing multiple simultaneous trials of picking the cards blindfolding and throwing a die. You note that the number shown by the method of picking up a card and throwing a real world die, sums up to a number between 2 and 12.
