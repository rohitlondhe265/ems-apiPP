#1. Consider two tumblers, the first containing one litre of water. Suppose you take one spoon of water out of the first tumbler and pour it into the second tumbler and after which you take one spoon of the mixture from the second tumbler and pour it back into the first tumbler. Which one of the following statements holds true?
a. There is less coffee in the first tumbler than water in the second tumbler.
b. There is more coffee in the first tumbler than water in the second tumbler
c. There is as much coffee in the first tumbler as there is water in the second tumbler
d. None of the statements holds true.

Answer: C

Explanation: 
  Suppose spoon can contain 5 drops. Tumbler can contain 100 drops.
    1 --> 2 (spoon contains 5w drops)
            tumb 1: 95w
            tumb 2: 100c + 5w
    2 --> 1 (spoon contains 4c+1w drops)
            tumb 1 : 96w
            tumb 2 : 96c .
There is as much coffee in the first tumbler as there is water in the second tumbler.

#4. Spores of a fungus, called late blight, grow and spread infection rapidly. These pathogens were responsible for the Irish potato famine of the mid-19th century. These seem to have attacked the tomato crops in England this year. The tomato crops have reduced and the price of the crop has risen up. The price has already gone up to $45 a box from $27 a box a month ago. How much more would a vegetable vendor need to pay to buy 27 boxes this month over what he would have paid last month?
a. $ 27	            b. $ 18     	 c. $ 45	           d. $ 486

Answer: D

Explanation: 
 Since the price of a box increased from $27 to $45.there will be loss of 18 for one box. so for 27 boxes it equals 27*18=486. 

#5. A car manufacturer produces only red and blue models which come out of the final testing area completely at random. What are the odds that 5 consecutive cars of the same colour will come through the test area at a time?
a. 1 in 16	b. 1 in 125	c. 1 in 32         d. 1 in 25

Answer: A

Explanation: 
 Total 5 cars each can have any of the 2 colours, so the total possibilities are 2*2*2*2*2= 32.
The Favourable outcome is the same colour for all the 5 cars = 2 (all 5 are red or all 5 are blue.) 
Hence the probability = 2/32 = 1/16.
OR
2*(1/2)^5 =1 in 16
As there are 5 Cars and 2 types.

#6. Susan made a block with small cubes of 8 cubic cm volume. To make the block she used 3 small cubes long, 9 small cubes wide and 5 small cubes deep. She realizes that she has used more small cubes than she really needed. She realized that she could have glued a fewer number of cubes together to lock like a block with same dimensions, if it were made hollow. What is the minimum number of cubes that she needs to make the block?
a. 114		b. 135		c. 21		d. 71

Answer: A

Explanation: 
 The total volume (in terms of number of cubes) of the solid = 3*9*5 = 135
The total volume (in terms of number of cubes) of the hollow = (3-2)*(9-2)*(5-2) 
= 21
So number of cubes required = 135-21 = 114

 You can check through the option and find it. if we take option 1.it is given that 1 watermelon,2 dates,1 plum for each child. So, he should have bought 3 watermelon, 6 dates, and 3 plums for all the three. But it is given that he spends only 7 pennies. When you check the cost of all the fruits .the only option satisfies the given condition is 1 Watermelon, 2 Dates and 1 Plum.

#10. An athlete decides to run the same distance in 1/4th less time that she usually took. By how much percent will she have to increase her average speed?
a. 0.25	       b. 0.5	  c. 0.3333	    d. 0.2

Answer: C

Explanation: 
 Let original speed be s1 and time be t1
Then s1=d/t1 ---eqn 1 and according to ques new speed be s2 and time given is 3t1/4 therefore s2=d/(3t1/4) -----eqn 2 dividing eqn 2 by eqn 1
s2=4s1/3 increased speed = 4s1/3-s1
=1s1/3 percent increase=[(1s1/3)/s1]*100 =33.33%=33.33/100=0.3333..

#14. In a family there are some boys and girls. All boys told that they are having equal number of brothers and sisters and girls told that they are having twice the number of brothers than sisters. How many boys and girls are present in a family?
a. 5 boys & 3 girls		b. 7 boys & 2 girls
c. 4 boys & 3 girls		d. 6 boys & 2 girls

Answer: C

Explanation: 
 Let number of boys =b
And number of girls=g;
Since each brother having equal no of brothers and sisters
So b-1=g
Girls told that they are having twice the no. of brothers than sisters
b=2(g-1)
Therefore 1+g=2g-2
g=3 and b=1+3=4
So answer is 4boys and 3 girls

#16. There are N numbers of gold biscuits in the house, in which four people are lived. If the first men woke up and divided the biscuits into 5 equal piles and found one extra biscuit. He took one of those piles along with the extra biscuit and hid them. He then gathered the 4 remaining piles into a big pile, woke up the second person and went to sleep. Each of the other 3 persons did the same one by one i.e. divided the big pile into 5 equal piles and found one extra biscuit. Each hid one of the piles along with the extra biscuit and gathered the remaining 4 piles into a big pile. If N>1000, what could be the least value of N?
a. 1249	            b. 1023               c. 1202            d. 1246

Answer: D

Explanation: 
 Suppose N=5x+1
A took (x+1) biscuit.
Now 4x is of the form 5y+1 then x must be in the form 5z+4
⇒4(5z+4)=5y+1
⇒y=4z+3 and x=5z+4
The ratio of number of biscuits that A and B took is 
[(5z+4)+1]:[(4z+3)+1]=5:4
So, we can say that any two successive persons A, B, C and D take coins in the ratio of 5:4
Let the number of biscuits that A, B, C and D took be a, b, c and d respectively.
a:b=b:c=c:d=5:4
a:b:c:d=125:100:80:64
⇒a=125k
⇒x=125k−1 and N=5x+1=625k−4
As, N>1000, the least value of N is when k=2
⇒N= 1246.
 
#17. ABCDEF is a regular hexagon inscribed inside a circle. If the shortest diagonal of the hexagon is of length 3 units, what is the area of the shaded region?

a. 1/6(3Π − (9√3)/2)	b. 1/6(2Π − (6√3)/2)
c. 1/6(3Π − (8√3)/2)	d. 1/6(6Π − (15√3)/2)

Answer: A

Explanation: 
 Let side of regular hexagon be a. 
The shortest diagonal will be of length a√3. Why? 
A regular hexagon is just 6 equilateral triangles around a point. The shortest diagonal is FD. 
FD = FP + PD
△FOE is equilateral and so is △ EOD. 
Diagonal FD can be broken as FP + PD, both of which are altitude of equilateral is.
FP = (√3a)/2
FD = √3 a = shortest diagonal
The question tells us that the shortest diagonal measures 3 cm. 
√3 a = 3 => a = √3
Radius of circle = √3
Area of hexagon = (√3 a2)/4 x 6
Area of circle – area of hexagon = π (√3)2 − √3/4 x (√3)2 x 6
= 3π − (9√3)/2
Area of shaded region = 1/(6 ) (area(circle) – area(hexagon))
= 1/(6 )(3π − (9√3)/2)


#18. Abhishek starts to paint a fence on one day. On the second day, two more friends of Abhishek join him. On the third day 3 more friends of him join him and so on. If the fence is completely painted this way in exactly 20 days, then find the number of days in which 10 girls painting together can paint the fence completely, given that every girl can paint twice as fast as Abhishek and his friends (Boys)? (Assume that the friends of Abhishek are all boys).
a. 20		b. 40		c. 45		d. 77

Answer: D

Explanation: 
 Number of men working on first day = 1
Number of men working on second day = 3
Number of men working on second day = 6 and so on..
Total number of boys till the end of the work = [n(n + 1) (n + 2)] / 6
= [20 x 21 x 22] / 6 = 1540
Given that every girl paints twice as fast as Abhishek’s friends.
Hence, 20 girls work is being done.
Thus, the number of days taken to paint the fence = 1540/20 = 77.

#19. Six friends decide to share a big cake. Since all of them like the cake, they begin quarrelling as to who gets to first cut and has a piece of the cake. One friend suggests that they blindfold a friend and then choose from a well shuffled set of cards numbered from one to six. You check and find that this method works as it should be simulating a fair throw of a die. You check by performing multiple simultaneous trials of picking the cards blindfolding and throwing a die. You note that the number shown by the method of picking up a card and throwing a real world die, sums up to a number between 2 and 12. Which total would be likely to appear more often 8, 9 or 10?
a. 8	b. 9	c. 10	d. All are equally likely.
