1. Fill dirt or fill soil is usually the sub-soil removed from an excavation site and is used to level a place or create artificial mounds. If the average density of sub-soil removed from a site is 3gm/cu cm and it weight 400 kg. How many hemispherical pits each of volume 240 cubic cm, can this sub-soil fill?
a. 555		b. 277		c. 556		d. 554
Answer: A
Explanation: 
3 gm per cm cube and there are hemispheric pits of capacity 240 cm cube
So each hemisphere can contain 3*240=720 cm cube soil.
So total of 400 kg i.e. 400*1000=400000 gms will be held in 400000/720=555.55 so approximately 555.

11. Joe counts 48 heads and 134 legs among the chicken and dogs in his farm. How many dogs does he have?
a. 29		b. 21		c. 18		d. 19
Answer: D
Explanation: 
Let us take the no. of Chickens as C and no. of dogs as D.
Equation 1: C + D = 48
Equation 2: 2C + 4D = 134 (2 legs for Chicken and 4 legs for Dogs)
Solving eqns 1 and 2, we get, D = 19 and C = 29.
No. of dogs is 19.

12. A family consists of father, mother, two sons and the youngest daughter. The age of first son and daughter are in the ratio 3:1. The mother is 3.5 times as old as the second son. The age of the second son is 2/3 of the age of the first son. The age of the youngest daughter is 5 years. What is the age of the mother?
a. 40		b. 35		c. 15		d. 25
Answer: B
Explanation: 
Let us take the ages of Father, Mother, First son, Second son and daughter as F, M, S1, S2 and D respectively.
Given,
S1: D = 3: 1
M = 3.5 (S2)
S2 = 2/3 (S1)
D = 5
Now, S1: D = 3: 1 => S1 = 3D => S1 = 3(5) => 15
So, S1 = 15
S2 = 2/3 (S1) => S2 = 2/3(15) => 10
S2 = 10
M = 3.5 (10) => 35
Mother's age is 35

13. A bag contains 20 yellow balls, 23 green balls, 27 white balls. How many minimum balls one should pick out so that to make sure he gets at least 2 balls of all colour?
a. 48		b. 52		c. 60		d. 68

Answer: B
Explanation: 
The highest number from one colour ball is 27 (white balls), the second highest is 23 (green)
So, as a worst case scenario, one should take all 27 and 23 to move to get 2 yellow balls. 
So, 27 + 23 + 2 = 52
One should at least take 52 balls to get minimum 2 balls from all colours.

14. A pipe can fill a tank in 3 hrs .Due to a leakage in the tank it takes 3.5 hrs to fill the same tank. Then how many hours will the leakage can empty the tank.
a. 3.5 hrs			b. 30 hrs
c. 0.5 hrs			d. 21 hrs
Answer: D
Explanation: 
The electric pump can fill the tank in 3 hrs. Because of the leak it took 3.5 hrs.
Now, if there is no leak and the electric pump works for 3.5 hrs instead of 3 hrs, 0.5/3 = 1/6 of the tank must have been overflown. But we are unable to see the overflow because this 1/6 is emptied by the leak of course working for 3.5 hrs.
Hence the leak can empty 1/6 of the tank in 3.5 hours. So it can empty a full tank in 21 hrs.

16. Mr. X decides to travel from Delhi to Gurgaon at a uniform speed and decides to reach Gurgaon after T hr. After 30 km, there is some engine malfunction and the speed of the car becomes 4/5th of the original speed. So, he travels the rest of the distance at a constant speed 4/5th of the original speed and reaches Gurgaon 45 minutes late. Had the same thing happened after he travelled 48 km, he would have reached only 36 minutes late. What is the distance between Delhi and Gurgaon?
a. 90 km	b. 120 km	c.20 km	           d. 40 km
Answer: B
Explanation: 
 Let the distance from Delhi to Gurgaon be ‘d’ km. The first 30 km he travels at his usual speed. However, the remaining‘d-30’ km he travels at a reduced speed.
To travel ‘d’ km he usually takes T hr. Therefore, to travel ‘d - 30’ km he should ideally take (d−30)xT/d hr. However, this is only if he travels at his usual speed. It is given that he travelled only at 4/5th of his usual speed. Because of this he would have taken 5/4th of the time to travel the remaining distance, i.e., he takes 1/4th of the time extra. This is given to be 45 minutes (or 3/4th hr)
1/4x(d−30)xT/d = 3/4      ........(1)
On the other hand, had the same thing happened after he travelled 48 km, he would have reached only 36 minutes or 34 hrs late. Hence,
1/4x(d−48)xT/d = 3/5       ........(2)
Dividing (1) by (2) and solving for d, we get d = 120 km.




17. What will be the remainder when (1234567890123456789)24 is divided by 2187?

19. John has chocolates of types A and B in the ratio 3 : 7, while Mike has chocolates of types B and C in the ratio 5 : 4, Ram has chocolates of types C and A in the ratio 3 : 5. If there are more chocolates of type C than of type B, and more of type B than of type A, what is the minimum possible number of chocolates overall?
a. 78		b. 40		c. 56		d. 72
Answer: A
Explanation: 
Again, big thanks to Mukund Sukumar for excellent solution.
Let john have 3x chocolates of type A and 7x of type B
Let Mike have 5y chocolates of type B and 4y of type C
Let john have 3z chocolates of type C and 5z of type A
So in total A=3x+5z; B=7x+5y; C=4y+3z
Since C>B we get solving y<3z-7x —>(1)
Since B>A we get solving 5y>5z-4x —> (2)
What gets inferred from above 2 statements is z>=3. So when x=1, z=3, we get only y=1 as choice, for which second condition doesn’t satisfy.
So, when x=1,z=4, we get y<5 from first condition and when y > 3.2 from second condition. So which gives choice the only y=4.
Hence x=1,y=4 and z=4 works and is the best possible answer.
For these values, we get A=23,B=27,C=28.
Minimum possible number of chocolates overall is 78. 

20. If a three digit number ‘abc’ has 3 factors, how many factors does the 6-digit number ‘abcabc’ have?
a. 16		b. 24	          c. 16 or 24		d. 20
Answer: C
Explanation: 
‘abc’ has exactly 3 factors, so ‘abc’ should be square of a prime number. (This is an important inference, please remember this).
Any number of the form paqbrc will have (a + 1) (b + 1) (c + 1) factors, where p, q, r are prime. So, if a number has 3 factors, its prime factorization has to be p2.
‘abcabc’ = ‘abc’ * 1001 or abc * 7 * 11 * 13 (again, this is a critical idea to remember)
Now, ‘abc’ has to be square of a prime number. It can be either 121 or 169 (square of either 11 or 13) or it can be the square of some other prime number.
When abc = 121 or 169, then ‘abcabc’ is of the form p3q1r1 1, which should have 4 * 2 * 2 = 16 factors.
When ‘abc’ = square of any other prime number (say 172 which is 289), then ‘abcabc’ is of the form p1q1r1s2 , which should have 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 = 24 factors
So, ‘abcabc’ will have either 16 factors or 24 factors.
