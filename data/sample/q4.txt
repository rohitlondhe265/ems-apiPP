2. The pacelength P is the distance between the rear of two consecutive footprints. For men, the formula, n/P = 180 gives an approximate relationship between n and P where, n = number of steps per minute and P = pacelength in meters. Bernard knows his pacelength is 120 cm. The formula applies to Bernard’s walking. Calculate Bernard’s walking speed kmph.
a. 236.16	b. 8.78	        c. 12.44            d. 15.55
Answer: D
Explanation: 
 n/P = 180 gives an approximate relationship between n and P where, n = number of steps per minute and P = pacelength in meters. Bernard knows his pacelength is 120cm.
Number of steps in one minute = 180*1.2 
Distance travelled in 1 minute = 180*1.2*1.2 metres
Distance travelled in one hr = 180*1.2*1.2*60/1000 km = 15.55 km approx

7. 10 suspects are rounded by the police and questioned about a bank robbery. Only one of them is guilty. The suspects are made to stand in a line and each person declares that the person next to him on his right is guilty. The rightmost person is not questioned. Which of the following possibilities are true?
A) All suspects are lying
B) The leftmost suspect is guilty
C) Rightmost suspect is guilty
a. A only		b. A and B
c. B only 		d. A and C
Answer: B
Explanation: 
 If first is victim then all suspects are lying. Here you should remember that the rightmost person is not questioned.
If any of the person leaving leftmost is victim then the leftmost suspect is innocent. But "and" should not be used between the conditions because leftmost is not innocent necessarily.

10. 66 people {a1, a2,..., a66} meet and shake hands in a circular fashion. In other words, there are totally 36 handshakes involving the pairs, {a1, a2}, {a2, a3}, ..., {a65, a66}, {a66, a1}. Then size of the smallest set of people such that the rest have shaken hands with at least one person in the set is
a. 22		b. 33		c. 65		d. 11
Answer: A
Explanation: 
 For minimum people in a set we can consider handshakes as {a1, a2, a3}, {a4, a5, a6},
{a7, a8, a9},…….{ an-2,an-1,an}
For minimum people, we can consider the set {a2, a5, a8… an-1}.
So, MINIMUM people in a set = n / 3
so n/3=66/3=22

12. Anoop managed to draw 6 circles of equal radii with their centres on the diagonal of a square such that the two extreme circles touch two sides of the square and each middle circle touches two circles on either side. Find the ratio of the side of the square to the radius of the circles. Assume √2 is 1.4.
a. 9:1	              b. 6.2: 1          c. 10.4: 1	          d. 7.6: 1
Answer: C
Explanation: 
Let the radius of circle be r
Let the side of square be a
Then diagonal of square= a*sqrt(2)
This diagonal length = 12*r + 2r * sqrt(2)
(Because the extreme circle's radius is perpendicular to side of square.)
Thus we get
12*r+2r*sqrt(2)=a*sqrt(2)
r (6*sqrt(2)+2)=a
r/a=1/(6*sqrt(2)+2)
Thus ratio: r: a = 1 :( 6*sqrt(2)+2)
 = 1: 10.4
So, a : r = 10.4 : 1

18. Janta Airline has a free luggage allowance for its passengers. If any passenger carries excess luggage, it is charged at a constant rate per kg. The total luggage charge paid by Ravind Jekriwal and Pranas Shubhan is Rs.1100. If both Ravind and Pranas had carried luggage twice the weight than they actually did, their luggage charges would have been Rs.2000 and Rs.1000 respectively. What was the charge levied on Ravind’s luggage?
a. Rs.600	b. Rs.800          c. Rs.900	          d. Rs.700
Answer: B
Explanation: 
Let the free luggage allowance be ‘f’ kg. Let the weight of the luggage carried by Ravind be ‘r’ kg and the weight of the luggage carried by Pranas be ‘p’ kg. Thus, the excess luggage weights carried by Ravind and Pranas respectively are (r – f) kg and (p – f) kg. 
Thus, the total luggage charge for both would be (r – f) k + (p – f) k if k is the charge per kg.
Thus, (r – f) k + (p – f) k = 1100.
(r + p – 2f) k = 1100....................... (1)
If Ravind carried twice the luggage weight he actually did, i.e., if he carried 2r kg, then the excess luggage weight he carried would have been 2r – f and the corresponding charge would have been (2r – f) k.
Therefore, (2r – f) k = 2000................ (2)
Likewise, If Pranas carried twice the luggage he actually did i.e., if he carried 2p kg, then the excess luggage he carried would have been 2p –f and the corresponding charge would have been (2p – f) k.
Therefore, (2p – f) k = 1000................ (3)
Adding (2) and (3) and simplifying, we get,
(r + p – f) k = 1500........................ (4)
Dividing (4) by (1) and simplifying, we get,
19f = 4r + 4p............................. (5)
Dividing (2) by (3) and simplifying, we get,
–f = 2r – 4p............................. (6)
Solving (5) and (6) for r, we get,
r = 3f................................... (7)
Subtracting (1) from (4) and simplifying, we get,
fk = 400.
Ravind’s luggage charge = (r – f) k.
But, according to equation (7), r = 3f. Therefore, Ravind’s luggage charge = 2fk
But, fk = 400. Therefore, Ravind’s luggage charge = Rs. 800.

19. Consider a class of 40 students whose average weight is 40 kgs. m new students join this class whose average weight is n kgs. If it is known that m + n = 50, what is the maximum possible average weight of the class now?
a. 40.18 	b. 40.56            c. 40.67              d. 40.49
Answer: B
Explanation: 
 If the overall average weight has to increase after the new people are added, the average weight of the new entrants has to be higher than 40.

So, n > 40
Consequently, m has to be < 10 (as n + m = 50)
Working with the “differences” approach, we know that the total additional weight added by “m” students would be (n - 40) each, above the already existing average of 40. m (n - 40) is the total extra additional weight added, which is shared amongst 40 + m students. So, m
(n – 40) / (m + 40)
has to be maximum for the overall average to be maximum.
At this point, use the trial and error approach (or else, go with the answer options) to arrive at the answer.
The maximum average occurs when m = 5, and n = 45
And the average is 40 + (45 – 40) * (5 / 45)
= 40 + (5 / 9)
= 40.56 kgs

20. Let n! = 1 x 2 x 3 x……….x n for integer n> 1. If p = 1! + (2 x 2!) + (3 x 3!) + …… (10 x 10!), then p+2 when divided by 11! Leaves remainder of
a. 10		b. 0		c. 7		d. 1
Answer: D
Explanation: 
 If P = 1! = 1
Then P + 2 = 3, when divided by 2! Remainder will be 1.
If P = 1! + 2 × 2! = 5
Then, P + 2 = 7 when divided by 3! Remainder is still 1.
Hence, P = 1! + (2 × 2!) + (3 × 3!)+ ……+ (10 × 10!)
Hence, when p + 2 is divided by 11! The remainder is 1.
